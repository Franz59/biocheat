BioCheat - A Facebook Biotronic Cheat..er.. Hinter!
---------------------------------------------------

This project is a mix of different small things:

- image processing (Training and recognition of patterns)
- AI (Solving the Biotronics puzzle)
- screen grabbing (ok, that's a oneliner :-))
- visualizing the 'moves'

How to GET it
=============

**Windows Users**: just check the [Downloads Tab](http://github.com/fagas/biocheat/downloads)
and grab the latest archive for windows ;-) [only 2.9MB with integrated Qt4.5].  

IMPORTANT:

- If it says something about a missing MS DDL, you have to install the popular vcredist_x86.exe (Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 DLL)
- If the 'hint' mode doesn't work, it means that the calibration si not good! check with the recognize tab if all the blocks are recognized!!

**Linux Users / Windows POWER USERS**
Just get it from http://github.com/Eros/biocheat and open it with QtCreator,
so you can build and run it (ok, you can do the usual "qmake; make;" stuff
on the console/cmd.exe prompt if you like more ;-))

How to USE it
=============

 1. login to facebook and start the Biotronics application
 2. star this app
 3. tune the parameters to focus on the Biotronics gamefield (as shown on the screenshot) **it's very important that the field is closely contained into the capture rectangle. check the correctness of the alignment whith the 'recognize' mode**
 4. switch to the 'hint' visualization, as shown on Readme.png
 5. PLAY, and BEAT all your friends!!
 6. tell them you're not evil, but you're cheating ;-)
